        <h2>ITIS 3135 Contract</h2>
        <p>I, Caden Clark agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2024 ITIS 3115 Web-Based Application Design and Development with my
            instructor, Daniel I. von Briesen.
            I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be
            publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate
            for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
            Signed:
            Caden Clark, September 9th, 2024</p>
