        <section>
        <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a></h3>
        <p>An online retailer that sells many different products.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: Utilizes the same color scheme throughout where product images, prices, and buttons stand out distinctly against a neutral background.</li>
            <li>Repetition: Uses consistent design elements throughout the site, specifically the search bar, nagivation menu, and logo. </li>
            <li>Alignment: Elements are aligned neatly with a structured layout. The product listings are in a grid alignment.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Related information such as product information and the "Add to Cart" button are placed in close proximity.</li>
        </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www2.pnwx.com/">Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.</a></h3>
            <p>An online catalog for an x-ray equipment company.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Very little contrast with the dark neon background behind black and yellow links, making it hard to read.</li>
                <li>Repetition: Each product page is pretty consistent in layout, however some of the color choices seem random and don't fit with the rest of the page.</li>
                <li>Alignment: A lot of the product pages have sections of text that aren't aligned with one another.</li>
                <li>Proximity: The proximity of elements isn't horrible and the spacing of elements seems conistent.</li>
            </ul>
